# 2024-06-13

Attendees: hexa, vcunat, Julien (partially), Eelco

## Round table

- Julien
    - currently otherwise occupied
    - wants to finish the Lime survey migration away from AWS EC2 to non-critical infra
- vcunat
    - Full disk on Haumea
    - Checking on tarball mirroring service
        - wasn't working for the last two weeks, we failed to notice
        - issue in nixpkgs caused breakdown
        - tending to the script and will merge the fixed version back
- hexa
    - Haumea's backup location
        - Super write-intensive
        - Return to rsync.net
    - tried updating delft/* to 24.05 but hydra wouldn't compile
- Eelco
    - Interested in the cost-increase on the release bucket
        - March 6xxx USD
        - April 9700 USD
        - May 8200 USD
        - Still increasing as of June
    - Need to move forward with the S3 Bucket (Cache & Releases)
        - Move data into Glacier, would be cheaper there, but not accessible from cache.nixos.org anymore
        - Moving things out of Glacier expensive, cheaper when we batch requests and request them for the next day or so
        - Plan to move to Tigris data, they would give us a discount, and egress is currently free
        - Need to get the relevant people in a room to make a final decision
            - Eelco
            - Edef
            - Jonas
            - Infra Build (hexa, vcunat)

## Action items
- Check Prometheus Alerting Pipeline, no Alerts since May 21
- File issue about hydra/nix build failures
- Schedule call about S3 bucket decision with Eelco, Jonas, Infra-Build

## Full disk on haumea
- The ZFS pool (1 TB) on Haumea has been running full in the last few days, leading to the PostgreSQL database to be unavailable
- Multiple options
    - Reducing number and frequency of snapshots
        - 3x5m, 4x15m, 24x1h, 4x1d, 3x1w
            - [vcunat] 5 minutes probably excessive
    - Replace haumea with a machine with bigger disks
        - AX101 ~100 EUR/Mo
    - Long-term maybe prune Hydras database
        - or set up a new database and copy only the config over

- Spend some more time debugging the situation, if it doesn't work out go for a bigger machine

## Acquire rsync.net account for database backups of haumea
- Previously rsync.net, but Account was paid by Graham. He eventually deleted that account
- Currently only backup location is on hexa's NAS at home
- Backup size is currently 1.7TiB
- At 1.2 Cents per GB/Month that would cost ~24 USD/Month for 2TiB
    - https://www.rsync.net/signup/order.html

## E-Mail Alias Management
- Rok would like access, so that he can switch around the alias on the streamyard account that the Marketing team uses
- Resource currently managed by Infra-Build
- Not enough opinions, discuss in internal infra room instead

### Changelog
- Non-Critical-Infra updated to NixOS 24.05
    - migrated to systemd initrd
- Local Postfix setup for mail delivery from vault.nixos.org
- Owncast instance at live.nixos.org was set up
- Synapse Reverse-Proxying uses Unix Domain Sockets now
