Attendees: delroth, Janik, dgrig, vcunat, raitobezarius, hexa, Linus, Weija

## Topics

- [delroth] Bringing up the topic of Keycloak / Kanidm again
  - We'll probably want it for Jitsi? I'd also love to drop user management stuff from Hydra.
  - Other use cases:
    - Wiki? (I'm guessing mediawiki can SAML)
    - Pads? (for meeting notes that we'd rather not have vandalized)
    - Calendar?
    - Hydra? https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/pull/1298
  - [hexa] Requirements:
    - GitHub login, and being able to read organization membership info
    - Maybe Dex can do what we want as well? Proxy to backend apps
        - @raitobezarius in chat: [oauth2-proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/providers/github/) as well exist
        - @raitobezarius in chat: [SATOSA Proxy](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA) can be used to do SAML2<->Social Login

- [delroth] releases.nixos.org S3 costs
  - tl;dr discovered last week that the bandwidth costs rose significantly for no known reason
  - Shape of the growth looks organic but there shouldn't really be anything causing it.
  - Fastly logs analysis showed nothing interesting.
      - Some access is blocked by [eelco not sharing credentials](https://github.com/NixOS/infra/pull/388#discussion_r1545856527)
  - Enabled S3 logging, haven't analyzed yet.
  - Cost Explorer might be indicating that this isn't actually releases.nixos.org but something else in eu-west-1 also using S3? But then what? (or is Cost Explorer broken? wouldn't be too surprising)

- [Janik] Jitsi on non-critical-infra
  - nixpkgs+infra PRs were reviewed
  - Still blocked on tracking down a bug
  - Probably will land soon (if someone helps with debugging)

- [delroth] What do we still not have access to?
