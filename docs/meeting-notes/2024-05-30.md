## Topics

- [hexa] Vaultwarden mail delivery
    - prevents onboarding of new people
    - https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/430
    - solution: https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-wiki-infra/blob/main/modules/postfix.nix
    - talking to Julian if he can take it, with fallback to hexa

- Netlify
    - Need to talk to Marketing if GitHub pages would be sufficient
        - Netlify provides preview environments
    - Annoying because
      - it's expensive,
      - DNS is crap, 
      - cost is per-user
      - so we have to share a password.

- [hexa] API modernization in sign-binary-cache script
    - https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-channel-scripts/pull/72
    - Not used for hydra.nixos.org
    - Should close the PR and remove the script to not mislead more people

- [zimbatm] Wants to transition out of the team
    - Talked with hexa previously in private to take over team lead
    - The person doing the things should be leading the team
    - Transition out over the next month or so
    - Maybe focus for the next month could be on making contributing to the infra repo more comfortable, needs more people who contribute to infra feel welcome
